Simple Node & Git Server Setup Scripts
======================================

Assumptions
-----------

* You have already booted your server
* You have a DNS entry pointing to the server
* Your sever is running Ubuntu (Tested with 14.04 x64 LTS)
* You're using linux or osx (windows user can do this but ssh key wise is more complex)


Server Setup
------------

Ssh into your server and run the following command (replace example.com with your domain).

```bash
DOMAIN=example.com FTP_USER=max FTP_USER_PASSWORD=password bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidtsuji/noleg-stack-with-ftp/master/init.sh)
```

Setup SSH Keys
--------------

For extra security, the git account doesn't not have password authentication or terminal access so we need to setup a trust between your computer and the server using your computers public key.

If you haven't already done this on your local machine in the past, generate your keys.
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | sudo tee -a /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Now send the key to the server so it knows to trust you.
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh root@example.com "cat >> /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh root@example.com "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

```
You should now be able to ssh into your server without providing a password. Remember this only works on your local computer though.

Create and Deploy Your Site
---------------------------

On your local machine do the following to setup a basic site

```bash
# Clone the bare git repo from the server
git clone git@example.com:example.com.git
cd example.com

# Generate an express site
sudo npm install -g express-generator
express --force --sessions --css stylus --ejs ./
echo "node_modules" > .gitignore

# Add to git and publish
git commit -am "Initial commit"
git push origin master
```

Once this runs, you should be able to go to http://example.com and see the website you just created.


Creating New Sites
------------------

Now that we are setup, if you want to create another site on the same server all you have to do is one one command on the server.
```bash
./setupBasicSite.sh test.foobar.com 3001
```
Now you can git clone git@example.com:test.foobar.com.git and push your new site.

Don't forget you will have to use port 3001 or you will get conflicts.
